# MMTP_Parser
This repository has a c# project that can connect to Market data feed (MDF) and received DIFF/RLC messages from it. I creat it and test it in Amman Stock Exchange to test the feed messages. Any one can clone this code and use it as he want without any restriction and without any guarantee from me.
